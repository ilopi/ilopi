## 🚀 About Me  
I'm a passionate Web & Software Developer with a strong foundation in web development and experience in various programming areas, including Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and RPA.  

Although I started my academic journey in a completely different field, my curiosity and love for learning led me to discover software development — and I haven’t looked back since.  

💼 Currently, I'm working at a tech company, growing professionally in a path not centered on SAP. While I have formal training in ABAP, my current and future focus is more aligned with **backend development**, **SQL databases**, and **web technologies**.

🎓 I've completed a **Higher National Diploma in Web Application Development (DAW)** and continue expanding my skills in software development.
